** Description
[TEMPORARY] Test repo for testing migration of wiki (and maybe other stuff)
** Plan
+ This is a test-bed for conversion of the trac wiki to a github wiki

*** DONE Stage 1: Dump the Trac wiki
CLOSED: [2019-10-16 Wed 19:58]
+ Main difficulty was getting access to the server, but now sorted
+ Also ~trac-admin~ only seems to work when run from inside the ~webapps/trac/bin~ directory
+ Commands to dump the wiki files and tar them up
  #+begin_src sh
    cd webapps/trac/bin
    ./trac-admin ../trac wiki dump ~/will-trac-wiki-dump
    cd ~
    tar czf will-trac-wiki-dump.tar.gz will-trac-wiki-dump
  #+end_src
*** Stage 2: Import wiki pages into github repo
There are two options here:
1. Leave files as in current format
   + It appears that trac wiki format is similar to moinmoin and mediawiki, but not quite the same as either
   + Github offers the following formats
     - AsciiDoc
     - Creole
     - Markdown
     - MediaWiki
     - OrgMode
     - Pod
     - RDoc
     - Textile
     - RestructuredText
   + I will try copy a file verbatim and adding a mediawiki extension
     - [-] Try with ~CompilingCloudyC17~
2. Convert to markdown
   + There are various scripts that claim to do this
     + pandoc
       #+begin_src sh
         pandoc --from mediawiki --to markdown -o WikiStart.md WikiStart
       #+end_src
       - This was my first attempt
     + https://gitlab.xiph.org/ePirat/trac-to-gitlab has a Trac2Down.py
